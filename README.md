# train-homework

I created train schedule application where users can see and add train information.
Please, click on link [train schedule application](https://zhakina90.github.io/train-homework/ "train schedule application")  to see the application.

- All information's stores in _Firebase_ Database.

* Here is the link to
  [Database](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/train-time-assignment-ea900/database/train-time-assignment-ea900/data/ "Stored user's input information")

- I used Moment.js to manipulate with time.

* If users click on new added train information it would highlight to a different color.
