# train-homework

I created train schedule aplication where users can see and add train information.
Please, click on link [train schedule aplication](https://zhakina90.github.io/train-homework/ "train schedule application")

- The new information which were inputed by user stores in _Firebase_.

* Here is the link:
  [Database](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/train-time-assignment-ea900/database/train-time-assignment-ea900/data/ "Stored user's input information")

- I used Moment.js to manipulate with time.
